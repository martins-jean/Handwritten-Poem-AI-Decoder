# CAN AI DECODE A HANDWRITTEN POEM?

## MULTI-LAYER PERCEPTRON FOR OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION

### PROJECT GOAL
Decoding a poem that was handwritten letter by letter on paper.

### METHODOLOGY
Supervised Learning

### PROBLEM TYPE
Computer Vision

### STEP-BY-STEP OUTLINE

I. Find or create a labelled dataset to train our neural network.

II. Create a neural network.

III. Train, test and optimize the accuracy of the MLP.

IV. Scan the handwritten letters that form the short poem.

V. Evaluate whether the model is able to reveal the meaning of the poem by converting each letter into typed text.

### DATA SOURCES
EMNIST dataset composed of 145,600 images of handwritten letters.

### KNOWN LIMITATIONS
Similar projects normally have to deal with the segmentation problem where AI is challenged to recognize where a handwritten letter ends and another begins. In this case, each handwritten letters was written in a separate paper sheet so it 

The EMNIST dataset was extremely useful for the roman alphabet but other datasets would be needed to deliver the same results on a variety of foreign alphabets.
### TECHNOLOGIES USED
